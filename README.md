The addon GildenSteuer calculates from a percentage that you determine how much gold from your loot goes into the guild bank.
The gold will be deposited automatically the next time you visit the guild bank.
Gold that you received from letters (post) will also be paid into the guild bank,
but will also be withdrawn directly.
